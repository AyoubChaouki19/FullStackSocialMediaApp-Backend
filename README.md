## FullStackSocialMediaApp Backend

### Used Technologies:

- **Node.js:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables you to build robust server-side applications using JavaScript. It serves as the foundation for handling the backend logic of the application.

- **Express.js:** Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, utilized to create structured routes and build APIs. It streamlines the management of HTTP requests and responses on the backend.

- **Sequelize:** Sequelize is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js. It offers an abstraction layer for interacting with relational databases. With Sequelize, you can define models and execute database operations using JavaScript, enhancing the efficiency of database interactions.

- **MySQL:** MySQL stands as an open-source relational database management system. It was employed as the database for storing and retrieving data in this project.

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWT is a technology used for authentication. It facilitates the creation of tokens that can be exchanged between the frontend and backend to verify user identity. It is important to note that while JWTs serve as a beginner-friendly way to illustrate web security concepts, they are not recommended for real-life applications due to security vulnerabilities.
